# ROLL AND CASH: GROCERY LORDS

A game made in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2024 using the [MoonWorks](https://github.com/MoonsideGames/MoonWorks) game framework.

Available [on itch.io](https://prophetgoddess.itch.io/roll-and-cash-grocery-lords).

In December 2024, Evan upgraded the code to use the latest version of MoonWorks. This now serves as a decent example of a small but complete game that uses the MoonWorks framework.

You will need to run the ContentBuilderUI project first. This will generate the content files necessary to build and run the game.
